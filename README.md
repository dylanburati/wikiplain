## wikiplain

A toolkit for processing Wikimedia XML dumps and Wikitext. Also includes
a part-of-speech tagging TCP service.

I use these to take an English Wikipedia snapshot, a collection of Reddit
post logs, and the [UMBC webbase corpus](https://ebiquity.umbc.edu/resource/html/id/351/UMBC-webbase-corpus)
and estimate the level of name recognition for each article's subject. This
helps when curating the default _People_, _Places_, and _Characters_ decks
in my [trivia game](https://github.com/dylanburati/datagame.live).
